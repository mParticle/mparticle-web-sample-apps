# mParticle Web Sample Apps

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

Hello! This is the mParticle Web Sample Apps Repository. We've built a collection of fully functional sample apps that provide a best practice approach to integrate with our [mParticle Web SDK](https://github.com/mparticle/mparticle-web-sdk) and other services we provide.

## Getting Started

This repository serves as directory of individual, self-contained, Sample Apps. Each application is a full project with working code, detailed implementation documentation and an integrated CI/CD pipeline via Github Actions.

Our recommenation is to fork or download the entire repository and open a specific project in your IDE or Editor of choice. This will provide full project settings, including NPM tasks and Linting.

**NOTE** These Sample Apps require a mParticle account with an API key.

While the code might run and build without mParticle credentials, the SDKs will not upload events to our servers and will generate errors.

Please visit [our docs](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input) for more details on setting up an API Key.

### Sample Apps Directory

Below is a list of sample apps, with a brief description of their intended use case. Please navigate to an individual Sample App's README.md file for specific use cases and implementation details.
