# mParticle Web Sample Apps

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache_2.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

Hello! This is the mParticle Web Sample Apps Repository. We've built a collection of fully functional sample apps that provide a best practice approach to integrate with our [mParticle Web SDK](https://github.com/mparticle/mparticle-web-sdk) and other services we provide.

## Getting Started

This repository serves as directory of individual, self-contained, Sample Apps. Each application is a full project with working code, detailed implementation documentation and an integrated CI/CD pipeline via Github Actions.

Our recommenation is to fork or download the entire repository and open a specific project in your IDE or Editor of choice. This will provide full project settings, including NPM tasks and Linting.

:information_source: **Note:** These Sample Apps require a mParticle account and a valid Input API key.

While the code might run and build without mParticle credentials, the SDKs will not upload events to our servers and will generate errors. Please visit [our docs](https://docs.mparticle.com/guides/getting-started/create-an-input/#create-access-credentials) for more details on setting up an Input API key.

### Sample Apps Directory

Below is a list of sample apps, with a brief description of their intended use case. Please navigate to an individual Sample App's README.md file for specific use cases and implementation details.
